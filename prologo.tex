\section{Pr\'ologo}

Alan Kay, considered by some to be the father of object-oriented programming, identified the following characteristics as fundamental to OOP:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Everything Is An Object.
\item Communication is performed by objects communicating with each other, requesting that objects perform actions. Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages. A message is a request for action, bundled with whatever objects may be necessary to complete the task.
\item Objects have their own memory, which consists of other objects.
\item Every object is an instance of a class. A class simply represents a grouping of similar objects, such as integers or lists.
\item The class is the repository for behavior associated with an object. That is, all objects that are instances of the same class can perform the same actions.
\item Classes are organized into a singly-rooted tree structure, called the inheritance hierarchy. Memory and behavior associated with instances of a class are available to any class associated with a descendent in this tree structure.
 
\end{enumerate}
